# '_Robo-medivisor_' Heart Disease Prediction
SC1015 Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Mini-Project

## About
Acknowledging the severity of heart diseases and the benefits of its early detection, we aims to predict the possibility of individuals in contracting heart disease with the use of a [dataset retrieved from the IEEE](https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/heart-disease-dataset-comprehensive#files). With a machine learning model, the 'Robo-medivisor' will analyse this possibility with predictors from medical check-ups and alert the potential patients and doctors respectively for more in-depth checks.

## Motivation and Problem Statement
As the leading cause of death, accounting for 32% of all deaths in the world, we are motivated to reduce the implications of **heart disease** with early detection which allows for the best chance for successful treatment and survival.
- How can we assist doctors to speed up the diagnosis of heart disease to minimise further implications? 
- Which model is the best in predicting heart disease to aid in our early detection goal?

## Models Used
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Logistic Regression
