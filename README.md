# '_Robo-medivisor_' Heart Disease Prediction
SC1015 Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Mini-Project

## About
Acknowledging the severity of heart diseases and the benefits of its early detection, we aims to predict the possibility of individuals in contracting heart disease. With a machine learning model, the 'Robo-medivisor' will analyse this possibility with predictors from medical check-ups and alert the potential patients and doctors respectively for more in-depth checks.
