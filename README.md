# '_Robo-medivisor_' Heart Disease Prediction
SC1015 Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Mini-Project

## About
Acknowledging the severity of heart diseases and the benefits of its early detection, we aims to predict the possibility of individuals in contracting heart disease with the use of a [dataset retrieved from the IEEE] (https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/heart-disease-dataset-comprehensive#files). With a machine learning model, the 'Robo-medivisor' will analyse this possibility with predictors from medical check-ups and alert the potential patients and doctors respectively for more in-depth checks.
